# RibaRun 🏃‍♂️💰

A financial simulation side-scroller game where you navigate the challenges of personal finance while avoiding the pitfalls of interest (Riba), inflation, and impulse spending.

## Game Concept

RibaRun is an HTML5 Canvas-based infinite runner that teaches financial literacy through gameplay. Players must manage two critical resources while avoiding obstacles and traps that threaten their financial well-being.
